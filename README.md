🚢 Titanic Classification Project 🚢

In this project, the goal is to predict survival on the Titanic using a machine learning classification model. You explore the famous Titanic dataset to determine which passengers survived and which didn’t based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, etc. 🧑‍💻

Dataset Overview 📊: The Titanic dataset contains details about passengers, including age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not. This project uses this data to build a predictive model.

Preprocessing 🧹: Missing values in important features like age and cabin need to be filled or handled before fitting the model. You cleaned the dataset using pandas, dealing with null values and encoding categorical variables like gender.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍: You visualized the data with matplotlib to understand patterns. For instance, women and children had a higher chance of survival, while passengers in lower classes faced more danger. 🚶‍♀️🛳️

Feature Engineering 🔧: You created new features from existing ones, such as extracting titles from names or simplifying the fare column. This step improves the model's accuracy.

Model Selection 🤖: You tested various classification models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests (sklearn), to determine the most accurate one.

Evaluation 📈: The models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score to select the best one.

Final Model 🏆: After tuning, the best model was used to make predictions on the test set, achieving a decent performance.

Conclusion 🎯: Your classification model predicts the survival of Titanic passengers based on key features.
